# Trustlines Netstats DAppNode Package

The netstats client reports the state of your node to the [netstats page](https://netstats.tlbc.trustlines.foundation/) which gives a rough overview of the current network state.

It is an optional component which helps the community by providing information on your running node to a central server.

To participate, you first need to request credentials managed by the Trustlines Foundation. Please email `netstats@trustlines.foundation` to do so.

## Trustlines

The [Trustlines Protocol](https://trustlines.network/) aims to provide the service of “transfer of value” without actually transferring value. This can be accomplished by leveraging networks of mutual-trust. The [Trustlines Protocol](https://trustlines.network/) is being built to support a range of use cases by leveraging existing networks of mutual trust and mapping trust-based relationships onto trustless infrastructure.

The official documentation of [Trustlines Network](https://trustlines.network/) can be found [here](https://docs.trustlines.network/)
